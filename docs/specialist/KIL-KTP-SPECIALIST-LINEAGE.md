# KIL–KTP specialist lineage log

## Purpose

This is the durable briefing and decision log for KTP specialists reviewing the
Kinetic Infrastructure Layer (KIL). It preserves why the project exists, how
its architecture evolves, where it relies on KTP, what it may add to KTP, and
which claims remain unapproved or unvalidated.

This log records lineage; it is not itself the normative KIL specification.
Later entries may refine or supersede proposals, but earlier entries remain as
an audit trail.

## Logging convention

Every substantive KIL turn records:

- the input or question;
- the current interpretation;
- whether the result is confirmed, proposed, or unresolved;
- the rationale and protocol implications;
- affected artifacts; and
- the next design gate.

Evidence language retains the project-wide meanings:

- `observed`: directly supported by a named primary source;
- `modeled`: an explicit counterfactual assumption or synthetic signal; and
- `validated`: behavior reproduced in the local reference implementation.

## Lineage before the formal log

### L-001 — Original ambition

**Status:** Historical context

The founder asked for a deeply innovative public demonstration of how AI has
changed and accelerated cybersecurity. The initial option space included an AI
Security Debt Index, AI red/blue arena, LLM pentest toolkit, AI-attacker
honeypots, Zero Trust for Agents, and a security accelerator with a standardized
red-team gauntlet.

### L-002 — KTP changes the center of gravity

**Status:** Historical context

Adding KTP redirected the work toward trajectory-bound authorization for
autonomous agents. The central opportunity became demonstrating that authority
can depend on how an identity is moving through a system, rather than only on a
static credential or one-time policy decision.

### L-003 — Ambient enforcement and KIL

**Status:** Foundational concept; implementation not yet approved

The work reframed zero trust from a checkpoint decision into a continuously
recomputed property enforced at an infrastructure boundary. This produced the
terms **Kinetic Infrastructure Layer** and **ambient enforcement**. The concept
includes decaying authority, trajectory evidence, infrastructure enforcement,
decision provenance, and safe degradation for legitimate rare events.

### L-004 — Incident replay and trust model

**Status:** Source drafts; not validated

The July 2026 Hugging Face agent-intrusion timeline was selected as the public
counterfactual case. Two source drafts were created: a side-by-side incident
timeline and a trust-decay model. They remain preserved inputs, not approved
specifications or proof that KIL would have prevented the incident.

### L-005 — Paired project and evidence contract

**Status:** Confirmed

KIL became a paired technical paper and executable reference implementation,
with an offline deterministic incident replay and local Kubernetes validation.
The project adopted the `observed` / `modeled` / `validated` evidence contract
and explicitly reserved `validated` for locally reproduced behavior.

### L-006 — First architecture candidate

**Status:** Proposed; awaiting architecture approval

The initial hybrid two-timescale candidate used one deterministic decision
interface for replay and live enforcement:

```text
permit = veto_clear ∧ A(action) ≤ E(environment) ∧ Q_i,c ≥ τ_c ∧ evidence_fresh
```

`Q_i,c` was provisionally described as ephemeral, identity- and
authority-class-bound trajectory charge. Its reducing-only boundary prevents it
from overriding a KTP veto or expanding the KTP environmental envelope.

## Turn-by-turn specialist record

### T-001 — 2026-08-27 — Resume at Architecture Gate 1

**Input:** Resume work at the first architecture approval gate.

**Interpretation:** No lab implementation begins until the KTP/KIL semantic
boundary, components, data flow, safety behavior, and test strategy are approved
and written as a reviewed specification.

**Status:** Confirmed process gate.

**Affected artifacts:**

- `docs/checkpoints/2026-08-24-specialist-consultation.md`
- `docs/design-drafts/hybrid-two-timescale-architecture.html`

**Next gate:** Resolve whether `Q_i,c` is a KIL extension, an expression of KTP,
or an implementation-local metric.

### T-002 — 2026-08-27 — Specialist interpretation of `Q_i,c`

**Input:** The KTP specialist views `Q_i,c` as an expression of existing KTP
constructs. He views KIL as a layer on top of KTP that extends the protocol and
could become part of KTP 2.1 or possibly 3.0.

**Working interpretation:**

- `Q_i,c` should not be introduced as an independent trust primitive competing
  with KTP.
- KIL should derive the runtime quantity from explicitly mapped existing KTP
  constructs.
- The extension candidate is the operational contract for continuous,
  transport-bound enforcement: how derived KTP state is carried, refreshed,
  consumed, constrained, and audited at the infrastructure layer.
- Version placement remains unresolved. A backward-compatible, optional
  extension may fit KTP 2.1; changes to core semantics or wire invariants may
  require KTP 3.0.

**Status:** Specialist direction confirmed; exact construct mapping and version
classification remain proposed pending detailed review.

**Rationale:** This preserves KTP as the source of trust semantics while making
KIL the execution and enforcement realization. It avoids inventing a parallel
trust system and keeps the reference implementation useful whether the
extension is standardized in 2.1 or deferred to 3.0.

**Affected artifacts:** The architecture draft and later extension proposal
must replace language that presents `Q_i,c` as a standalone KIL primitive with
language describing a derived KTP enforcement state. No artifact has been
modified yet; Architecture Section 1 remains unapproved.

**Next gate:** Identify the existing KTP constructs that contribute to the
derived runtime state and define the minimum new transport-enforcement contract.

### T-003 — 2026-08-27 — Preliminary check against KTP v2.0.0 structure

**Input:** Before refining the architecture, compare the specialist direction
with the authoritative KTP v2.0.0 RFC inventory rather than relying on earlier
brainstorming terminology.

**Preliminary mapping:** The published KTP structure already assigns the likely
inputs and enforcement responsibilities across existing specifications:

- KTP-Core: Trust Score, Context Tensor, Trust Proof, Silent Veto, and
  anti-Goodhart measures;
- KTP-Identity: Vector Identity, Trajectory Chains, and Proof of Resilience;
- KTP-Gravity: real-time constraints and the physics of denial;
- KTP-Enforce: Policy Enforcement Points, Trust Tiers, Adaptive Dormancy, and
  Mass Ceiling;
- KTP-Transport: wire formats and real-time transport protocols; and
- KTP-Audit: Decision Geometry, immutable logging, forensics, and
  counterfactual analysis.

**Working interpretation:** These existing constructs support the specialist's
view that `Q_i,c` should be derived rather than standardized as a second trust
score. The plausible new KIL contribution is a narrow composition and runtime
binding contract across existing RFCs, plus reference behavior and conformance
vectors for transport-native enforcement.

**Status:** Preliminary. The RFC inventory supports the direction, but the full
normative text must be mapped clause-by-clause before declaring an extension
gap or selecting KTP 2.1 versus 3.0.

**Primary source:** [KTP v2.0.0 RFC repository](https://github.com/nmcitra/ktp-rfc/tree/v2.0.0).

**Next gate:** Decide whether KIL exposes one composite derived enforcement
state or preserves the contributing KTP values independently through the hot
path.

### T-004 — 2026-08-27 — Composite enforcement state selected

**Input:** KIL enforcement points should consume a **signed, short-lived
composite KTP enforcement state** rather than independently recomputing
authority from all individual KTP inputs on every action.

**Decision:** Confirmed architectural direction.

**Interpretation:**

- KTP remains authoritative for the trust semantics and derivation of the
  effective enforcement state.
- The hot-path KIL adapter verifies and consumes a compact, signed state rather
  than ingesting raw Context Tensor observations or reproducing the complete
  KTP computation.
- The state must be bound to the relevant identity, authority class, execution
  environment or zone, action scope, issuance time, expiry time, ordering or
  freshness data, and the applicable veto/envelope result.
- The state must carry or reference sufficient derivation and evidence digests
  for KTP-Audit Decision Geometry without exposing unnecessary raw context at
  every enforcement point.
- Expiry or failed verification cannot expand authority. Exact stale-state
  behavior remains part of the safety design.

**Why this direction:** It gives eBPF, service-mesh, Kubernetes, and later
enforcement adapters one stable verification contract; reduces latency and
privacy exposure; prevents different enforcement points from deriving
inconsistent authority; and creates a concrete candidate extension across
KTP-Transport, KTP-Enforce, and KTP-Audit.

**Still unresolved:**

- the normative name and schema of the composite state;
- which KTP component or quorum may issue and sign it;
- TTL and refresh semantics by authority class;
- revocation and anti-replay behavior; and
- whether a KIL enforcement point may apply a local reducing-only overlay
  between signed refreshes.

**Affected artifacts:** The later architecture specification and extension
proposal will define the composite-state contract. The current visual remains a
draft until the local-overlay and failure semantics are approved.

**Next gate:** Decide whether local enforcement points may immediately reduce
the signed state using newer local evidence, or must wait for a newly signed KTP
state for every change.

### T-005 — 2026-08-29 — Main-paper opening thesis added

**Input:** The founder supplied the opening statement for the main paper on
Kinetic Infrastructure.

**Interpretation:** The paper will begin by framing cybersecurity as moving from
ambient risk and ambient threat toward continuous ambient breach, requiring a
corresponding move from detect-and-prevent operations to ambient enforcement.
Kinetic infrastructure is presented as the mechanism for enforcing immutable
constraints at adversarial AI speed rather than as a reactive security overlay.

**Decision:** Confirmed editorial direction. The supplied statement is now the
introduction of the main manuscript, with only spacing, HTML-entity, punctuation,
and minor grammatical normalization.

**Evidence status:** This is the paper's thesis and motivation, not a validated
result. Claims about the insufficiency of current controls, ambient breach,
autonomy, speed, and threat neutralization require sources, definitions, and
careful qualification during manuscript development.

**Rationale:** The introduction communicates the project's public purpose before
the paper enters KTP semantics, the extension boundary, formal model, replay,
local validation, limitations, and falsifiable claims.

**Affected artifacts:**

- `docs/paper/kinetic-infrastructure.md`
- `docs/paper/README.md`

**Unresolved questions:** The final paper title, citations supporting the
opening claims, operational definitions for `ambient breach` and `ambient
enforcement`, and whether “independent of human intervention” needs a safety
qualification in the opening remain subject to editorial review.

**Next gate:** Return to Architecture Gate 1 and decide whether local
enforcement points may apply an immediate reducing-only constraint between
signed KTP state refreshes.

### T-006 — 2026-08-29 — `Q_i,c` confirmed as a new KTP extension

**Input:** The founder clarified that `Q_i,c` is a new extension and should
relate to KTP as an extension for KTP 2.0, with a possible future expression in
KTP 2.1 or 3.0.

**Decision:** Confirmed architectural and protocol direction.

**Clarification of earlier lineage:** Entries T-002 and T-003 correctly preserve
the requirement that `Q_i,c` derive from existing KTP constructs and must not
become a competing trust system. This entry supersedes any reading of those
entries that would classify `Q_i,c` as merely an implementation-local metric or
as having no normative extension semantics.

**Current interpretation:**

- `Q_i,c` is a new, signed, short-lived KIL composite enforcement state.
- Existing KTP constructs supply its authoritative trust, trajectory,
  constraint, identity, enforcement, transport, and audit semantics.
- KIL adds the normative composition, binding, freshness, consumption,
  reducing-only enforcement, and audit contract required at infrastructure
  enforcement points.
- The initial specification is an extension profile layered on KTP v2.0.0.
- Backward-compatible standardization may fit KTP 2.1; changes to core
  invariants, mandatory processing, or wire semantics may require KTP 3.0.

**Rationale:** Treating the composite state as an extension makes KIL
interoperable and testable rather than leaving a critical authorization value as
private implementation behavior. Deriving it from KTP preserves semantic
continuity and prevents duplication of KTP trust primitives.

**Affected artifacts:**

- `docs/extension/README.md`
- `docs/checkpoints/2026-08-24-specialist-consultation.md`
- the future architecture specification, extension schema, conformance vectors,
  and transport adapters

**Unresolved questions:** Exact contributing KTP fields, schema name, issuer and
signature authority, TTL classes, revocation, replay protection, local
reducing-only behavior, and final KTP version placement.

**Next gate:** Decide whether local enforcement points may immediately apply a
reducing-only constraint between signed KTP state refreshes.

### T-007 — 2026-08-29 — Official KIL white paper initiated

**Input:** The founder directed the project to develop the official KIL white
paper using the KIL trust-decay model and the ambient-enforcement analysis of
the Hugging Face incident. The paper must be a handout deliverable, such as a
PDF, and must be tied directly to the lab/demo as supporting and authoritative
information. The founder-approved opening statement has already been supplied.

**Decision:** Confirmed deliverable and publication contract.

**Interpretation:**

- The white paper is a primary KIL deliverable, not retrospective marketing
  material added after the implementation.
- The canonical manuscript, executable replay, lab scenario, decision records,
  tables, and figures must derive from the same versioned evidence and result
  artifacts.
- Historical incident facts remain `observed`; counterfactual KIL inputs and
  outcomes remain `modeled`; only locally reproduced lab behavior may be called
  `validated`.
- The trust-decay and incident-timeline drafts are source material to be
  reconciled with KTP v2.0.0, the confirmed KIL extension direction, and primary
  incident sources before they become authoritative prose.
- The PDF must remain understandable as a standalone handout while providing
  precise references back to reproducible lab artifacts.

**Rationale:** A shared evidence chain prevents the paper and demo from drifting
into separate stories. It makes every quantitative figure, cutoff point, and
performance statement traceable to a source manifest, model version, or lab
run, while keeping unexecuted counterfactuals visibly distinct from validation.

**Affected artifacts:**

- `docs/paper/kinetic-infrastructure.md`
- `docs/drafts/kil-trust-decay-model.md`
- `docs/drafts/ambient-enforcement-vs-huggingface-incident.md`
- the future paper design specification, citation database, figure sources,
  generated PDF, replay reports, and lab run manifests

**Unresolved questions:** Primary audience, target length, handout context,
technical depth, author attribution, visual identity, publication versioning,
and the exact mechanism connecting manuscript claims to lab evidence.

**Next gate:** Select the paper's primary audience and target length before
choosing among executive, dual-layer, and research-paper structures.

### T-008 — 2026-08-29 — Hybrid two-timescale architecture required in paper

**Input:** The founder required the hybrid two-timescale architecture to be
integrated correctly into the official KIL white paper.

**Decision:** Confirmed publication and architecture-integration requirement.

**Interpretation:**

- The architecture will be part of the paper's central technical argument,
  rather than a detached illustration or optional appendix.
- The phrase *two-timescale* refers to two temporal control loops: (1) a slower
  authoritative loop that derives, signs, expires, and refreshes the composite
  KTP enforcement state, and (2) a faster data-plane loop that evaluates each
  requested action at the transport enforcement point.
- The offline historical replay and the live local-cluster validation are two
  execution rails that exercise the same decision contract; they are not the
  two timescales themselves.
- The paper, architecture figure, implementation interfaces, telemetry, and lab
  measurements must use the same terms and expose both loops distinctly.
- Whether the fast loop may impose a new local reducing-only constraint between
  signed refreshes remains an unresolved normative choice. The paper must not
  silently assume that authority until it is approved.

**Rationale:** Separating temporal loops from experimental rails prevents an
architectural category error. It also makes the lab capable of measuring state
freshness and refresh behavior separately from per-action enforcement latency,
while preserving the requirement that KIL cannot expand KTP authority.

**Affected artifacts:**

- `docs/paper/kinetic-infrastructure.md`
- `docs/design-drafts/hybrid-two-timescale-architecture.html`
- the future white-paper design specification and PDF figure set
- the future signed-state issuer, enforcement adapter, replay engine, telemetry
  schema, and lab result manifests

**Unresolved questions:** The permitted scope of fast-loop reducing-only local
constraints; refresh cadence and TTL by authority class; stale-state behavior;
paper audience and length; and the exact measurements shown in the figure and
demo.

**Next gate:** Decide whether the fast enforcement loop may immediately reduce
or withhold authority between signed composite-state refreshes, without ever
increasing authority or overriding a KTP veto.

### T-009 — 2026-08-29 — Authoritative KTP and incident citations required

**Input:** The founder required the white paper to cite the KTP v2.0.0 RFC
release, the official Enterprise KTP architecture, the KTP Constitution, and
the Hugging Face technical incident timeline.

**Decision:** Confirmed source and citation policy; initial citations added to
the canonical manuscript.

**Interpretation:**

- KTP v2.0.0 is the versioned normative baseline for protocol terminology and
  behavior used by the paper.
- The Enterprise KTP architecture is an official explanatory source for the
  action-authorization plane, enforcement surfaces, and least-trajectory
  framing.
- The KTP Constitution is the governing source for the principles against which
  KIL safety, graceful degradation, accountability, and immutable constraints
  are evaluated.
- The Hugging Face technical timeline is the primary source for observed facts
  in the public incident case study.
- No citation to the incident report converts a KIL counterfactual into a
  validated result. Modeled inputs and outcomes remain labeled as such until
  reproduced in the local lab.
- The canonical KTP `CITATION.cff` remains included for formal attribution.

**Rationale:** Assigning each source a defined evidentiary role prevents
explanatory pages from silently becoming normative protocol text and prevents
incident facts from being conflated with untested KIL prevention claims.

**Affected artifacts:**

- `docs/paper/kinetic-infrastructure.md`
- the future citation database, claim-evidence matrix, figure captions, and PDF
- the future replay trace and lab result manifests

**Unresolved questions:** Final bibliography style; author and institutional
attribution; archival snapshots or persistent identifiers for web sources; and
the exact paragraph-, event-, and figure-level citation mapping.

**Next gate:** Resolve the fast-loop reducing-only authority question, then
select the paper's primary audience and target length.

### T-010 — 2026-08-29 — Trust model and incident analysis to become one asset

**Input:** The founder directed that the complete scope of the local trust-decay
model and the supporting ambient-enforcement analysis of the Hugging Face
incident be incorporated into the official paper as one unified asset.

**Decision:** Confirmed consolidation requirement. Manuscript structure and
normalization rules remain proposed pending founder approval.

**Interpretation:**

- The trust-decay draft will supply the mechanism: definitions, trajectory
  divergence, passive decay, asymmetric replenishment and loss,
  authority-class isolation and coupling, thresholds, cold start, declared
  trajectory changes, and known calibration gaps.
- The incident-analysis draft will supply a phase-by-phase worked application of
  that mechanism, followed by the executable replay and local validation design.
- The hybrid two-timescale architecture will connect the theory and example:
  signed composite-state issuance and refresh in the slower loop, per-action
  transport enforcement in the faster loop, and the offline and live rails as
  two executions of the same decision contract.
- The documents will not be concatenated verbatim. Duplicate introductions,
  incompatible notation, unsupported certainty, and repeated conclusions will
  be reconciled into one argument.
- The trust quantity currently named `E_i,c` in the source draft must be mapped
  to the confirmed `Q_i,c` KIL extension vocabulary, with `E(environment)`
  reserved for the KTP environmental envelope to avoid symbol collision.
- The current diagonal weighted standardized-distance formula must not be called
  a full Mahalanobis distance unless covariance is actually represented.
- Incident parameters and counterfactual outcomes are `modeled`; observed event
  facts are cited to the Hugging Face disclosure; only reproduced local lab
  outcomes may be `validated`.
- Strong statements such as “would block” or “credentials are irrelevant” must
  be expressed as conditional model outcomes with explicit sensor, placement,
  freshness, and enforcement assumptions until validated.

**Rationale:** A unified paper can serve simultaneously as the conceptual
argument, protocol-extension rationale, mathematical specification, public case
study, and lab companion only if its notation, evidence classes, and execution
contract are consistent end to end.

**Affected artifacts:**

- `docs/paper/kinetic-infrastructure.md`
- `docs/drafts/kil-trust-decay-model.md` (preserved source input)
- `docs/drafts/ambient-enforcement-vs-huggingface-incident.md` (preserved source
  input)
- `docs/design-drafts/hybrid-two-timescale-architecture.html`
- the future paper design specification, claim-evidence matrix, figures, PDF,
  replay reports, and lab manifests

**Unresolved questions:** Founder approval of the unified paper structure;
fast-loop reducing-only authority; mathematical profile for the first reference
implementation; final paper length and primary audience; and which incident
phases can be faithfully reproduced in the local lab.

**Next gate:** Approve or revise the proposed dual-layer unified-paper structure
before manuscript consolidation begins.

### T-011 — 2026-08-29 — Lab and demo validation phase initiated

**Input:** The founder directed the project to begin the validation phase with
the KIL lab/demo.

**Decision:** Confirmed transition into lab-validation design. This entry does
not claim that any KIL behavior has yet been validated.

**Interpretation:**

- The unified paper structure is sufficiently accepted to proceed with its
  evidence-producing lab workstream.
- Validation will be artifact-driven: each run must bind the scenario version,
  input provenance, model and parameter version, signed-state profile,
  enforcement mode, decision records, environment manifest, and measured
  outcomes.
- The first phase should be deterministic and offline so arithmetic,
  provenance, evidence labels, cutoff claims, and decision reproducibility can
  be tested before a cluster adds timing and platform variability.
- The live phase should then run paired benign and adversarial trajectories in a
  local Kubernetes environment and compare a defined credential/policy
  baseline with the KIL decision contract.
- The fast-loop reducing-only question should be represented as two explicit
  experimental modes: signed-state consumption only, and signed state plus a
  bounded local reducing-only overlay. Experimental comparison does not itself
  approve the overlay as a normative KTP extension behavior.
- A claim may enter the paper as `validated` only when it is reproduced by the
  implementation and its run bundle passes integrity and provenance checks.
- The current host has a suitable bundled Python 3.12 runtime, but no `docker`,
  `kind`, `kubectl`, or `helm` executable was discovered. Live-cluster setup is
  therefore a prerequisite decision; it must not block deterministic replay
  validation.

**Proposed validation sequence:**

1. Specify falsifiable claims, controls, evidence schema, and run-bundle format.
2. Implement the pure deterministic decision kernel with unit and property
   tests, using test-first development.
3. Normalize a source-cited subset of the Hugging Face trace and label all
   synthetic KTP context inputs as `modeled`.
4. Execute paired baseline and KIL replays and generate machine-readable
   decision records plus a paper-ready report.
5. Provision the selected local cluster substrate and reproduce representative
   benign and adversarial trajectories against the same decision interface.
6. Test stale state, missing evidence, false-positive controls, declared
   trajectory changes, signature failure, replay attempts, and reducing-only
   invariants.
7. Promote only reproducible local outcomes to `validated` and bind the paper's
   tables and figures to immutable run identifiers.

**Rationale:** Leading with the deterministic rail creates a falsifiable and
reviewable model before platform details can obscure errors. A later live rail
then validates enforcement behavior and latency without conflating a local
experiment with proof of the historical counterfactual.

**Affected artifacts:**

- the future lab-validation design specification and implementation plan
- `src/kil/`, `schemas/`, `scenarios/hugging-face-july-2026/`, and `tests/`
- `adapters/kubernetes/` and `deploy/kind/` or the selected replacement
- `docs/paper/kinetic-infrastructure.md`
- future replay reports, lab run bundles, figures, and claim-evidence matrix

**Unresolved questions:** Approval of the phased validation sequence; selection
and installation of a local container and Kubernetes substrate; exact baseline
control; first incident cut points; model profile and parameters; and normative
status of the local reducing-only overlay.

**Next gate:** Approve the deterministic-first, paired-replay-then-live-cluster
validation design before the specification and test-first implementation plan
are written.

### T-012 — 2026-08-29 — Deterministic-first validation design approved

**Input:** The founder selected option 1: deterministic replay first, followed
by the live local-cluster rail.

**Decision:** Confirmed validation architecture and sequencing. A formal design
specification has been created for founder review.

**Interpretation:**

- The pure decision kernel, evidence model, normalized historical scenario, and
  replay run bundle stabilize before any Kubernetes adapter is implemented.
- The control, signed-state-only mode, and signed-plus-local-reduction mode are
  evaluated over identical normalized actions.
- The local overlay remains experimental and reducing-only; testing it does not
  grant it final normative KTP status.
- The live rail reuses the replay schemas and decision contract and begins only
  after deterministic and historical-replay acceptance gates pass.
- The lab specification defines falsifiable gates, safety cases, metrics,
  artifact integrity, and the rule for promoting a paper claim to `validated`.

**Rationale:** This order isolates model and provenance errors before introducing
cluster variability and makes the later visual demo an execution of an already
reviewable contract.

**Affected artifacts:**

- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-29-kil-lab-validation-design.md`
- the future deterministic-rail implementation plan
- future code, schemas, tests, scenario fixtures, run bundles, paper results,
  and live-cluster design

**Unresolved questions:** Founder review of the specification; concrete signed
state encoding and signature profile after KTP compatibility review; exact
reference parameters; live adapter and cluster substrate; and final normative
status of the local reducing-only overlay.

**Next gate:** Founder reviews the lab-validation design specification. After
approval, produce the test-first deterministic-rail implementation plan.

### T-013 — 2026-08-29 — Correction propagation status clarified

**Input:** The founder asked whether all corrected elements are retroactive to
the project's main data.

**Status:** Clarification confirmed; propagation is incomplete by design and by
current implementation stage.

**Interpretation:**

- The corrected terminology, evidence rules, two-timescale distinction,
  reducing-only invariants, and initial mathematical profile are authoritative
  in the approved-direction lab-validation specification and this lineage.
- The canonical paper currently contains the corrected citation and evidence
  boundary, but it does not yet contain the consolidated trust model, incident
  analysis, or full corrected notation.
- The saved architecture visual still requires revision to distinguish the
  authoritative refresh loop from the fast enforcement loop and to distinguish
  those timescales from the offline and live execution rails.
- The two files under `docs/drafts/` intentionally retain `E_i,c`, the
  “Mahalanobis” wording, and categorical counterfactual language because they
  are byte-preserved source artifacts with pinned checksums. They must not be
  retroactively edited.
- Scenario fixtures, schemas, code, replay data, and lab run bundles do not yet
  exist, so there is no implemented main dataset to migrate. They must be
  created directly from the corrected specification rather than generated from
  the preserved drafts without normalization.

**Rationale:** Provenance requires preserving original source artifacts while
canonical and generated artifacts adopt the latest approved semantics. Calling
all data corrected before that propagation occurs would hide real drift and
weaken the evidence chain.

**Affected artifacts:**

- `docs/paper/kinetic-infrastructure.md` (partial propagation)
- `docs/design-drafts/hybrid-two-timescale-architecture.html` (revision needed)
- `docs/drafts/kil-trust-decay-model.md` and
  `docs/drafts/ambient-enforcement-vs-huggingface-incident.md` (intentionally
  preserved)
- future normalized scenario, schemas, implementation, run bundles, figures,
  and PDF (must use corrected semantics from inception)

**Unresolved questions:** Whether to add an automated semantic-invariant test
covering canonical paper, architecture, schemas, code, and generated artifacts;
and when to revise the architecture visual relative to deterministic-rail
implementation planning.

**Next gate:** Founder decides whether to authorize a correction-propagation
pass across all mutable canonical artifacts before the implementation plan is
written.

### T-014 — 2026-08-29 — Canonical correction propagation completed

**Input:** The founder agreed with the propagation recommendation and directed
the project to execute it.

**Decision:** Completed across all current mutable canonical paper and
architecture artifacts. Preserved source drafts remain unchanged.

**Implementation:**

- The official manuscript now unifies the ambient-enforcement thesis, KTP
  extension boundary, corrected hybrid two-timescale architecture, formal
  trust-decay profile, Hugging Face incident counterfactual, validation lab,
  safety constraints, limitations, and authoritative references.
- Canonical notation uses `Q_i,c` for the signed composite enforcement state and
  reserves `E(environment)` for the KTP environmental envelope.
- The first mathematical profile is identified as a weighted diagonal
  standardized distance, not a full Mahalanobis distance.
- The manuscript separates observed incident facts, modeled context and
  counterfactual decisions, and locally validated results.
- The architecture visual now distinguishes the authoritative signed-state loop
  from the fast enforcement loop and labels offline replay and live validation
  as execution rails rather than timescales.
- The visual exposes the experimental local reducing-only overlay and states
  that the fast loop cannot replenish authority.
- Automated semantic-invariant tests now reject reintroduction of the old
  notation, overstated distance name, old charge label, or rail/timescale
  conflation in the canonical paper and visual.

**Rationale:** Corrections are now executable repository invariants rather than
editorial guidance. The main paper, visual, approved validation specification,
and future generated artifacts share one vocabulary and evidence boundary while
the provenance record remains intact.

**Affected artifacts:**

- `docs/paper/kinetic-infrastructure.md`
- `docs/design-drafts/hybrid-two-timescale-architecture.html`
- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-29-canonical-correction-propagation.md`
- `tests/test_canonical_semantics.py`
- `tests/test_consultation_checkpoint.py`
- `docs/specialist/KIL-KTP-SPECIALIST-LINEAGE.md`

**Preserved artifacts:**

- `docs/drafts/kil-trust-decay-model.md`
- `docs/drafts/ambient-enforcement-vs-huggingface-incident.md`
- all checksum-pinned transition and source-material records

**Unresolved questions:** Final signed-state encoding and KTP compatibility
mapping; reference parameter profile; live cluster substrate and adapter;
empirical status of the local reducing-only overlay; and author, design, and
publication metadata for the final PDF.

**Next gate:** Produce the detailed test-first implementation plan for the V1
deterministic decision kernel and V2 historical replay.
